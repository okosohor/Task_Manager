## Description
The Todo-manager project is a web application designed to help users effectively manage their tasks and stay organized. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can create, and track their to-do items. It is built using ***React***, ***JavaScript***, ***TypeScript***, ***HTML***, and ***SCSS*** following the ***BEM*** (Block, Element, Modifier) code structure methodology.

## Features
- Create new to-do items by providing a title and optional details.
- Edit existing to-do items to update the title or additional information.
- Mark tasks as completed with a checkbox or visual indicator.
- Reactivate or revise completed tasks by unchecking the completion checkbox.
- Track the completion status of each to-do item visually for easy identification.

## Usage
Feel free to customize the content, styles, and functionality of the Todo manager to suit your needs. You can modify the existing code or add new features as required.
